# Starter
This folder is for those who want to follow along with [my tutorial on medium](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/redux-toolkit-a-simple-example-workflow-20efcee54635).

After navigating into this folder, you can do the following:

```
npm install

npm start
```

Then follow along the steps in [this article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/redux-toolkit-a-simple-example-workflow-20efcee54635).
