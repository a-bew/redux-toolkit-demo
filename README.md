# Redux Toolkit Tutorial

This project contains a very simple workflow of how to get started with Redux using the Redux toolkit

In this repository are three folders:

- starter
- complete
- with createSlice

To follow along with the Tutorials, navigate into the starter folder and run npm install i.e.

```
cd starter

npm install

npm start
```

Then follow along the steps in this article.

If you get lost at any point, you can compare your solution to the content of the _complete_ folder.

The _with createSlice_ folder contains the code restructured to use slices.
